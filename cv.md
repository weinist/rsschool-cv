## About me:

    My thesis project at the university was related to programming, 
    and since then, I have gotten into it. To my mind, front-end development 
    is the first step for me on the path to full-stack web development.

## Skills:

    - HTML5
    - CSS3
    - Flexbox
    - Grid
    - JavaScript
    - БЭМ
    - SASS
    - git
    - Photoshop/Figma

**Code examples** can be seen in my [GitHub account](https://github.com/weinist)

## Work experience:
    
    Unfortunately, I have no real work experience in programming yet.

## Education:
 	
    I am a student at the front-end development department of Rolling Scopes School.
    Also I am a certified bachelor of the Faculty of Information Technologies and 
    Automated Control Systems at NUST "MISIS".

## English level:

    I have passed IELTS Academic English with 5.5 score, which is the border between B1 and B2 English levels.
